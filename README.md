This is an offline version of a blog creator that can create, modify, delete, and search blogs in a session.

The following features are present in the website:
1. The option to enter a title for each created blog. If no title is entered, it is generated dynamically.
2. The option to add basic bold, italics and underline formatting to the displayed blog contents using generated HTML wrappers on input boxes.
3. The ability to search for text contents within created blogs.
4. The ability to select number of blog post items displayed per page using a drop down selection.


The website is not connected to any online database and hence the contents will be cleared at the end of each session.
